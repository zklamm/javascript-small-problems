Hey Zac,

You've been an outstanding student, so I'll entertain the possibility. But let's say you get a remote job that pays $70k -- would you still be ok with that given the capstone fee? The main issue is that the fee, the capstone curriculum, and everything we do in capstone is try to get you into one of these "hypergrowth startups". The formula may not work so well if you're targeting companies of a different type and if the salary is a bit lower. 

Suppose we are ok with taking you -- are you ok given that capstone isn't built for those types of companies and your salary may not be a bit lower than our capstone average?




Chris,

-financially sound (i'm able via money)
-unique opportunity to give it all for the duration (i'm able via time)
-i'm smart (i'm able via my brain)
-my understanding of a '3 month experience' wouldn't be something i wanted without the mbl of the fundamentals taught by LS (i understand and appreciate the purpose and magnitude of the program)...a core curriculum that emphasizes mbl of fundamentals is the type i would want as a prereq for something like capstone
-new wife and house (and poodle...and future kiddos) (i'm motivated like never before)
-not worried about a lower than average capstone salary, i understand the value of the program and believe it will pay for itself time and again
-i'm looking for a fulfilling career. one thing i've learned over the past year and a half as i've looked into the industry...there are a lot of jobs out there i don't want. i'm seeking to problem solve. i want to leverage my understanding of powerful technologies in order to optimize a solution to a clients problem.
-i thrive on abstract thinking
-i left my job as a mechanical engineer making $93k + great benefits in order to pursue this because i want a career that will challenge me to constantly   learn to solve problems creatively.

i'm targeting a challenging, fulfilling job that will help to provide for my family. I would consider 70k a healthy start given my situation.


q's for Chris...

-in your intro to capstone vid, it seems like there is a lot of emphasis on location because of the presence of 'google-like companies' in specific areas.
-you don't mention remote jobs because they are harder I guess? how much harder? can i get a job? lol if the path seems realistic enough, then i think it's something i'd want to pursue
